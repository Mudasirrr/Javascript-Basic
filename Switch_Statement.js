//-------------------------------- Switch Statement --------------------------------
//-------------------------------- Switch Statement --------------------------------

// The Switch statement is part of the "Conditional" statements.
// The Switch can be used for when we have multiple test cases for a particular expression.
// If you find that you are having to write multiple "if else" statements then you may want to consider modifying the code into a switch. 


//First let's have an example of an if else statement...

// Variable to store a number.
const number = 1;

// If statement to check the condition of the number variable. ">" - this is a geater then symbol.
if (number > 0) {
  console.log('The number is positive');
} else {
  console.log('The number is negative');
}

//Now the Switch... using the same const variable from above.

switch (number) {

  case 1:
    console.log("The value of number is 1");
    break;

  case 2:
    console.log("The value of number is 2");
    break;

  case 3:
    console.log("The value of number is 3");
    break;

  case 4:
    console.log("The value of number is 4");
    break;

  case 5:
    console.log("The value of number is 5");
    break;

  default:
    console.log("The value of number is not given");
}

/*

The switch statement uses "case" syntax which compares the expression or the variable with the corresponding case... 
In this example the const variable stores the number 1 therefore the case and the code within it that is executed is "case 1" until the "break" keyword is found.
The "Break" keyword will end the execution process of the switch statement. If break is not added then it will contunue to execute further code.
If there is no matching cases, an optional "default" case can be used to execute a block of code regardless.   

If the "number" variable is equal to 5 then "case 5" of the switch statement will be executed.
