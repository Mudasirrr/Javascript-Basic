//Array of Numbers
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; 

//Function to output a string with a number from the above array to the console.
//The "num" is an parameter which it's value/argument will come from the forEach method as it's iteratoring thorugh the array.
function write(num) {
  console.log("This is number " + num)
}

//Using the forEach iterator on the numbers array and then calling the "write" function
numbers.forEach(write);


/* 

When the forEach iterator is used on an array it will execute the passed in function once for each element wihtin the array in order of the array. 

So in this case we have the numbers array with the forEach method and with the forEach method we are providing a callback function for the function "write".
The function will only run once for each element within the array as this is happening the element that the forEach method is currently on will be passed into the callback function, this is how we are able to use that element for the console.log output.
